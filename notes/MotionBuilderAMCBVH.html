<h1>Importing AMC/BVH and retargeting it to a new character</h1>

<p>To start, Load the file from File/Motion File Import, or drag and drop a set of files from the Asset Browser into the Viewer.

<p>Note: It's possible to load multiple files. Each one can be in a different take and share the same skeleton.

<p>After import, you should be able to preview each of the motions. Note that at this point, if you want to convert the input into a different format (for example, from AMC to BVH), you can do so without defining anything else. For example,
<ol>
 	<li>Plot all attributes (from the Edit menu)</li>
 	<li>Select the bones you wish to import from the Scene hierarchy (watch out for spaces in the name)</li>
 	<li>Go to File/Export motion</li>
</ol>
<p>Otherwise, if you would like to retarget the input motion to a new skeleton, we need to define Motion Builder characters for both the input and the output.
<ol>
 	<li>First, import the target skeleton into the scene. This skeleton can be in a skinned model. You can check the skeleton hierarchy in the Scene.</li>
 	<li>Next, create two MotionBuilder characters. To create a character, drag and drop a Character from the AssetBrowser (under templates/characters) into the Viewer. Rename each character so you know which corresponds to the input motion and which to the target output.</li>
 	<li>Next we must link the bones from each hierarchy into the corresponding Character. To begin, position each input skeleton to it is facing the +Z axis (VERY IMPORTANT!). If you do not have a 'Stance Pose' for the input motions, you can select the skeleton hierarchy from the Scene, right click, and choose Zero all rotations.</li>
 	<li>Double-click on the Character and look at the character definition tab.</li>
 	<li>Expand the corresponding skeleton hierarchy (right click, expand hierarchy).</li>
 	<li>Drag and drop the bones into the character definition list</li>
 	<li>Click characterize when finished</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, we can link the input motion to the new skeleton.
<ol>
 	<li>In the character controls, select the input character (top drop down list)</li>
 	<li>Set Edit/Input to 'character input'</li>
 	<li>In the character controls, select the output character (top drop down list)</li>
 	<li>Set Edit/Input to 'character input', BUT select the input character as the input.</li>
 	<li>The new character should now move with the input character. If you want to tweak the motion for the target character, you can do so using a control rig for the input character (control rig how-to is <a href="http://www.alinenormoyle.com/weblog/?p=411">here</a>).</li>
 	<li>To output the motion targeted to the new character, first select the output character in the character controls, Edit/Plot to Skeleton. Now you can export the motion by selecting bones and then going to File/Export.</li>
</ol>
<p>NOTE: You can lock a window, so you don't lose it when you click elsewhere
<p>NOTE: To delete something from the scene: Right click, select branches. Then delete.
